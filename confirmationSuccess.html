        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <h3>Signup for the Patient Registry</h3>
        <p>The Patient Registry is operated by the <a href="http://mmcc.maryland.gov/default.aspx">Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC)</a> and opens sometime in the spring of 2017—We'll let you know when it does. After signing up you’ll receive your patient number. Obtaining a Patient ID card is optional.</p>

      <div class="steps">
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <h3>Find your physician</h3>
        <p>Every physician on our website is registered with the MMCC. You give your physician your patient number, which they enter into a secure database in order to issue an online certification for medical marijuana.</p>

      <div class="steps">
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <h3>Find your dispensary</h3>
        <p>After finding an accessible dispensary, simply present your government-issued ID card (e.g., driver’s license or passport) for proof of identity, and the dispensary clerk will check to see that your physician entered you on the secure database.</p>
